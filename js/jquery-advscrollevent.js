/*
 * Usage:
 * Register Event Handler for Scroll-Up- and Scroll-Down-Event on windows (or other object):
 * $(window).advScroll({ options });
 * options may include:
 *	onUp(event, diff, scrollTop): function (default: null)
 *			Event handler function called when user has scrolled up for at least "upBy" pixels.
 *			"event" is the original scroll event, 
 *			"diff" is the amount of pixels scrolled up since last scrolling down, 
 *			"scrollTop" is the element's new absolute scrollTop value.
 *			"this" is bound to the sender object, e.g. window.
 *	upBy: int (default: 20)
 *			Amount of pixels to at least scroll up since last scrolling down before the onUp-Event is fired.
 *	onTop: boolean or function (default: false)
 *			If true, the onUp-function gets called upon reaching the top of the page.
 *			If a function, this very function gets called upon reaching the top of the page. 
 *			(The function's arguments are the same as those of onUp.)
 *	onDown(event, diff, scrollTop): function (default: null)
 *			Event handler called when user has scrolled down for at least "downBy" pixels, see onUp.
 *	downBy: int (default: 20)
 *			Amound of pixels to at least scroll down since loading doc or scrolling up before the onDown-Event is fired.
 *	onBottom: boolean or function (default: false)
 *			See "onTop", just referring to the bottom of the page. If "true", the onDown handler is re-used.
 *			Important: The onBottom event needs to find the element containing the scrollable content in order
 *			to calculate its height (or width in horizontal mode). If the jQuery plug-in is not applied to
 *			$(window), but to some other scrollable content like a DIV with CSS "overflow:scroll", the content
 *			of that container has to be specified in the "scrollableContent" property in order for
 *			the onBottom event to work properly!
 *	scrollableContent: jQuery resultset or (selector-)string (default: $(document))
 *			Currently only needed if the "onBottom" event is used.
 *			If the plug-in function is called on $(window), the default $(document) is correct, but if you
 *			call the plug-in e.g. on some DIV elements with CSS "overflow: scroll" or "overflow: auto",
 *			the content of those DIVs have to be wrapped in another element which is then to be selected
 *			as scrollableContent. If this is exactly one element, you may "preselect" it and assign the jQuery
 *			resultset to this property (as is the default $(document)). Otherwise you may simply assign a
 *			jQuery selector string which will then be executed locally inside the container element.
 *	oncePerDirection: boolean (default: false)
 *			If false, the events onUp resp. onDown fire continuously once the upBy resp. downBy threshold has been crossed.
 *			If true, each event is fired at most once per changing the direction.
 *	directionChangeDelayMillis: number (default: 50)
 *			If zero (0), any change of scroll direction will immediately trigger a "direction change", meaning
 *			the corresponding "onUp" or "onDown" event will fire after scrolling "upBy" resp. "downBy" pixels into
 *			the new direction.
 *			If greater than zero, this defines a delay in milli seconds which the page needs to stand still befor
 *			a direction change. Example: You are scrolling downwards, suddenly you scroll upwards for a bit without
 *			waiting for at least directionChangeDelayMillis milli seconds: This will not trigger a onUp-event,
 *			in continuous mode (oncePerDirection==false) it will still trigger the onDown event even though you're scrolling
 *			up, as this is still regarded as part of the same scrolling movement, a small irregularity, so to speek.
 *			However, if you keep scrolling up further and reach the point again, where you started to scroll down, this
 *			is no longer regarded as irregularity, but as an intended direction change despite the page not having
 *			stood still for this delay.
 *	horizontal: boolean (default: false)
 *			If set to true, the plugin works for horizontal instead of vertical scrolling.
 *			All properties keep their names, "onUp" refers to scrolling to the left, "onDown" to
 *			scrolling to the right etc.
 *
 * If you want to configure the "oncePerDirection" or "directionChangeDelayMillis" settings differently 
 * for the scrolling directions, you may use the following options:
 *	oncePerUp: boolean (default: undefined) 
 *			If defined, this setting overrides the "oncePerDirection" setting for scrolling upwards.
 *	oncePerDown: boolean (default: undefined) 
 *			If defined, this setting overrides the "oncePerDirection" setting for scrolling downwards. 
 *	downUpDelayMillis: number (default: undefined)
 *			If defined, this setting overrides the "directionChangeDelayMillis" setting for 
 *			the transition from scrolling downwards to scrolling upwards.
 *	upDownDelayMillis: number (default: undefined)
 *			If defined, this setting overrides the "directionChangeDelayMillis" setting for 
 *			the transition from scrolling upwards to scrolling downwards.
